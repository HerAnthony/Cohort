								<h2>What goes into building an ideal site?</h2>
								<p>Understanding what works and what doesn't work all depends on 5 W's:<br>Who, What,
									Where, When, Why <br>Who, are you targeting? What, services are you providing?
									Where, are the areas that need focusing? When, is it important or not important to
									put information or resources? Why, as in what sets your Law Firm apart?<br>
									Our research department has conducted numerous surveys of clients and layman users
									to collect human data in regard to what designs are effective and appealing to the
									end user. Our tracking software contains data about the UX/UI experience and
									collects the data into a usable resource. Tracking of time spent on sites, what
									pages have the most time spent, which button and links are clicked the most, how the
									information is shared with others among other data points is vital to understand
									which UX/UI features are the most effective of all.<br>
									After the data is collected, the Research and Development (R&D) team analyzes the
									data results and develops new ways to use the customer experiences for a more fluid
									interaction environment. As trends are changing, so are our design flows. As new
									developments arise, we adapt to them and have a forward thinking mentality of
									improving on what already exists. Working together with This Is How We Law we can
									forecast changes and work with you to ensure your site is always current and
									relevant. The only thing more important than content is getting to the content
									efficiently. </p>

								<h2>In UI</h2>
								<p>When it comes to the User Interface (UI) the most important concepts to keep in mind
									are that all of your sites feature must have a function, work properly, and are not
									broken. People who go to a site for content want that information as quickly and
									easily as possible. Users who have to deal with buttons not working, broken links,
									slow loading pictures and a site that is generally not visually appealing are far
									less likely to return to your site due to frustration.<br>
									Here at "This Is How To Law" we specialize in Quality Assurance (QA). Our quality
									assurance teams are dedicated to pouring over every feature, design and
									interaction that the Design Team put into your site to ensure that every feature
									works 100%. Our QA teams will also test your site on multiple platforms, devices,
									browsers ranging from cell phones to desktop monitors. Should your site have trouble
									while we create or maintain
									it, we guarantee that broken issues will become our top priority. Talk to specialist
									today about our maintenance packages to ensure your up-time is maximized.

								<h2>In UX</h2>
								<p>User Experience (UX) is the design layout of the site and how information or content
									is perceived by the end user. Any time you have a user who will access your site for
									content, the end goal is to have a natural flow to that content. The user should be
									able to follow the content to a defined end point. Guiding the customer to a
									specified end point will give your company the highest probability of users
									purchasing products or services after they review all of the content as long as it
									follows a logical order. This will increase your companies bottom line as users are
									more likely to purchase the longer they remain on the site.<br>
									At This Is How We Law we focus our design teams toward meeting this objective. Our
									design teams spend time creating content for your business that is relative,
									structured and engaging. We use original design concepts, images, and flows to
									ensure your customers will remain engaged for longer periods. Our specialist are
									trained to understand how law firms differ from other online products and services
									and will assist you with creating original content to fit your business needs. Reach
									out to a specialist today to discover the endless possibilities of your online
									presence.

								<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
								<p>The term "User Interface" or UI is normally related when talking about how a person
									interfaces computer systems, applications and web pages. People interact with the UI
									using the sight, sound, and touch senses combined with voice at times. The user
									manipulates input devices such as mouse, keyboard, microphone and joysticks to send
									commands into the computer, through the internet, to access servers, systems and to
									tell the hardware what to do. The systems then return a result based on the user
									request through output devices such as computer monitors, speakers and connected
									devices
									design to provide a sensory feedback. This cycle of events is called the
									input/output loop. in order to make the "User Experience" as fluid as possible, the
									UX/UI will need to be streamlined to load fast, provide quick response times, and
									have a natural flow. We can assist with designing a UX/UI that is most effective for
									the content you want users to engage ensuring that all features work as designed
									increasing customer satisfaction.<br>
									This engagement will keep customers returning to your website. A well designed site
									with content that is appropriate, brief and holds value to the user will keep users,
									client and customers returning. Often users will share sites that hold value with
									friends, family and clients increasing your overall profitability. The end results
									is dynamic increases in the products and services sold. Contact us below to speak
									with a specialist about the UX/UI services we offer today.</p>
